Code for *Decomposing the Training of Deep Learned Turbo codes via a Feasible MAP Decoder*

## TODO
- [ ] Transfer code over
- [ ] Only keep experiments in experiment_settings.json that are relevant
- [ ] Test for reproducibility
- [ ] Add some kind of link (or DVC repo) for training checkpoints used to make decomposition plots
- [ ] Add instructions on how to run
